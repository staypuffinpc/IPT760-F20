## basic operations in python ##
print (5 + 6) # addition
print (5 - 6) # subtraction
print (5.0 / 6) # division
print (6 % 5) # displays the remainder

print (4*5)

# create a variable
first = "Peter"
last = "Rich"

print (first + last)

lights = True
print (lights)

#lists
siblings = ["David", "Robyn", "Rebecca", "Michael","Peter","Dan","Matt", "Sarah","Liz", "Adam"]
ages = [46, 45, 44, 42, 41, 39, 39, 36, 33, 29]
print("I am " + siblings[4]+" and I am "+str(ages[4])+ " years old.")
